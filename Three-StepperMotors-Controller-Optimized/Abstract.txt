MCB2300:   Keil MCB2300 evaluation board with ULINK debugger
           - Application is loaded to internal Flash.


This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates the speed control of three stepper motors.
Three tasks are used, one task per stepper motor. I used timer interrupts to control time delay between each pluse.

The code was simualted and tested using Keil debugger. 

The speed profile algorithm was based on readings from the following papers:
